Quiz14 Automatic API Generator Tool

Overview

This repository serves as a demonstration of building APIs using LoopBack 4, a powerful and extensible Node.js framework. The following activities showcase the capabilities of LoopBack 4 through various tutorials and examples.

Activity 1: Getting Started
In this activity, we explore the fundamental steps to set up a LoopBack 4 project, create a basic application, and add a custom controller.

Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) installed on your machine.

Install LoopBack 4 CLI

The LoopBack 4 CLI is a command-line interface that simplifies project scaffolding. Install it globally using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm i -g @loopback/cli
Create a New Project

Use the CLI to create a new project by running:

bash
Copy code
lb4 app
Follow the prompts to configure your project, including enabling features such as eslint, prettier, mocha, etc.

Starting the Project

Navigate to the project directory and start the application:

bash
Copy code
cd getting-started
npm start
Visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/ping in your browser to test the project.

Adding Your Own Controller

Expand the project by adding a custom controller. For example, create a "Hello World" controller:

bash
Copy code
lb4 controller
Follow the prompts to generate an empty controller and paste the provided code into the generated file. Start the application again to see the "Hello World" response at http://127.0.0.1:3000/hello.

Activity 2: To Do Tutorial
This activity focuses on building a simple application using LoopBack 4 key concepts through a bottom-up approach. Explore the tutorial for detailed instructions.

Activity 3: Todo-List
The Todo-List tutorial introduces related models and demonstrates building their API based on LoopBack 4 principles. Follow the tutorial for a step-by-step guide.

Activity 4: SOAP Calculator
The SOAP Calculator tutorial guides you through integrating a SOAP web service into your LoopBack 4 project. Learn how to interact with SOAP APIs seamlessly.

How to Use

Each activity is organized in its respective directory within this repository. Follow the README.md files in each directory for step-by-step instructions and code samples.
